# Steganography App

Accoding to Hamid, 2017, Stegagraphy is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.


This system is designed to hide any type file in the image in order to protect data privacy. The system is developed on the basis of the algorithm Staga.It provides a platform that allows the user to it put image, read pixel height, pixel width and image size, calculate the file size limit that can be hidden, and a text box to browse the file. Upon adaptation of the proposed algorithm, the user can send the Stega image to other computer users so that the receiver can retrieve and read the data that is hidden in the Stega image.

Data privacy issues can arise from a wide range of sources such as healthcare records, criminal justice investigations and proceedings, financial institutions and transactions, biological traits, residence and geographic records and ethnicity. Data security or data privacy has become increasingly important as more and more systems are connected to the Internet. There are information privacy laws that cover the protection of data or information on private individuals from intentional or
unintentional disclosure or misuse. Thus, hiding the data in a kind of form such as within an image is vital in
order to make sure that security or privacy of the important data is protected.
